Experiment 4: Variable and Scope of Variable

1. Declare a global variable outside all functions and use it inside various functions to
understand its accessibility.

2. Declare a local variable inside a function and try to access it outside the function.
Compare this with accessing the global variable from within the function.

3. Declare variables within different code blocks (enclosed by curly braces) and test
their accessibility within and outside those blocks.

4. Declare a static local variable inside a function. Observe how its value persists
across function calls.
